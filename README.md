# Xbox Subscription Sales Dashboard  
**Excel Dashboard Project – Business Analysis Using the ABCD Methodology**

## Overview  
This project consists of the creation of a Sales Dashboard in Excel using a dataset of Xbox subscription plans.  
The goal was to transform raw subscription data into meaningful business insights by applying analytical methods, pivot tables, and visual storytelling.

A total of six Business Questions guided the structure of the dashboard.  
The first four questions followed the analysis model proposed in the DIO challenge, and the final two were added to extend the depth of the insights and enrich the dashboard.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information related to Xbox subscription sales, including:

- Subscription types  
- Season pass purchases (EA Play and Minecraft)  
- Revenue values  
- Auto-renew behavior  
- Coupon usage  
- Subscriber counts  

The data was pre-processed and validated to ensure consistency throughout the analysis.

# ABCD Methodology  
The development of this dashboard followed the ABCD methodology, ensuring an organized and structured analytical process.

### A — Assets  
Definition of visual identity, including:  
- Xbox-inspired color palette  
- Icons and graphic elements  
- Layout components to enhance readability and brand cohesion  

### B — Base of Data  
Utilization of a clean and consistent pre-processed dataset, ensuring:  
- Structural integrity  
- Correct data types  
- Eliminated redundancies  

### C — Calculations  
Construction of analytical elements such as:  
- Pivot Tables  
- Aggregated revenue metrics  
- Grouped and segmented totals  
- Summaries supporting each business question  

These calculations served as the foundation for all insights.

### D — Dashboard  
Creation of an interactive Excel dashboard containing:  
- Pivot charts  
- Filters and slicers  
- Segmentation by plan type, season pass, and auto-renew status  
- KPI cards and revenue highlights  

This enabled dynamic exploration and visualization of all key metrics.

# Business Questions Answered  
The dashboard was designed to address the following six key business questions:

1. What is the total revenue from annual subscription plan sales (considering all aggregated subscriptions)?  
2. What is the total revenue from annual subscription plan sales split between auto-renew and non–auto-renew customers?  
3. What is the total revenue generated from EA Play Season Pass subscriptions?  
4. What is the total revenue generated from Minecraft Season Pass subscriptions?  
5. Which subscription plan do customers tend to prefer?  
6. What is the total amount discounted via coupons, and how is coupon usage distributed across the subscription plans?

# Process  
To answer these questions, the following steps were performed:

1. Business questions were defined using the ABCD framework.  
2. Pivot tables were built to extract all necessary metrics.  
3. Aggregated values, segmentation, and comparisons were obtained from these tables.  
4. Charts and visual elements were created and placed into the dashboard.  
5. The final dashboard was assembled, combining interactivity and clear visual communication.
